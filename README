Handed in a zip file with all relevant files.

To compile:
1) Intel implementation: 
   - Change directory to the "build" folder. Run "make"

2) GPU implementation:
   - Change directory to the "src/cuda" folder. Run "make"

To Run:
1) Intel implementation:
   - After compiling inside the "build" folder, run for GL version:
      "./Lab09 ../resources/ ../resources/collide1231.txt"
      NOTE: collide1231.txt can be changed to any particle file.

   - After compiling inside the "build" folder, run for non-GL version:
      "./Lab09 100 ../resources/collide1231.txt"
      NOTE: collide1231.txt can be changed to any particle file. 
      100 can be changed to any number of steps.

2) GPU implementation:
   - After compiling inside the "src/cuda" folder, run for GL version:
      "./Lab09 ../../resources/ ../../resources/collide1231.txt"
      NOTE: collide1231.txt can be changed to any particle file.

   - After compiling inside the "src/cuda" folder, run for non-GL version:
      "./Lab09 100 ../../resources/collide1231.txt"
      NOTE: collide1231.txt can be changed to any particle file. 
      100 can be changed to any number of steps.
